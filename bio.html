                After completed coursework in Software Development at Year Up with specialized training in the Quality Assurance track, I have been able to develop my expertise in CSS, HTML, Java, and JavaScript. I am an emerging professional, passionate and highly motivated to utilize my coding experience and work collaboratively with team members debugging reports to maintain automation.

                <p>
                As an intern at Providence, I have built upon skills I learned in the classroom to become an adept software engineer. I am strong at code maintenance and am eager to utilize my coding experience to work collaboratively with team members debugging reports to maintain automation. While I am particularly strong in Javascript, I am coachable and eager to learn in order support team members in maintaining and stabilizing the production environment.

                <p>
                I have proven ability to communicate effectively and professionally across all departments and I am currently looking to contribute my knowledge to grow personally and professionally within a company.
